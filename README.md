# Circular-Queue-Data-Structure
A circular queue is a linear data structure that connects the rear and front ends, forming a circle. Unlike regular queues, when the rear reaches the end, it wraps around to the beginning if space is available. This eliminates the limitation of unused space in regular queues, making it more memory-efficient for fixed-size implementations.
